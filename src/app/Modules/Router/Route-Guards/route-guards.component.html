        <p>Angular Route Guards help us prevent the user from accessing certain parts of the applications under specific
            conditions. We can also use it to perform some actions before navigating to a route or leaving the route.
            The use cases for route guards are authorization, authentication, data collection, etc. The Angular supports
            several guards like CanActivate, CanDeactivate, Resolve, CanLoad, CanActivateChild, etc. This article will
            explore Angular Guards in detail by building an example Angular Guards application.</p>

        <b>Uses of Angular Route Guards</b>
        <p>01) To Confirm the navigational operation</p>
        <p>02) Asking whether to save before moving away from a view </p>
        <p>03) Allow access to certain parts of the application to specific users. </p>
        <p>04) Validating the route parameters before navigating to the route </p>
        <p>05) Fetching some data before you display the component.</p>

        <h3><span class="badge text-bg-primary">Types of Route Guards</span></h3>
        <b>1. CanActivate</b>
        <b>2. CanDeactivate</b>
        <b>3. Resolve</b>
        <b>4. CanLoad</b>
        <b>5. CanActivateChild</b>
        <b>6. CanMatch</b>

        <h5><span class="badge text-bg-secondary">1. CanActivate</span></h5>
        <p>The Angular CanActivate guard decides if a route can be activated ( or the component gets rendered). We use
            this guard when we want to check on some condition, before activating the component or showing it to the
            user. This allows us to cancel the navigation.
        </p>

        <b>Use cases</b>
        <p>Checking if a user has logged in</p>
        <p>Checking if a user has permission</p>
        <p>One of the use cases of this guard is to check if the user has logged in to the system. If the user has not
            logged in, then the guard can redirect him to the login page.</p>

        <h5><span class="badge text-bg-secondary">CanDeactivate</span></h5>
        <p>This Angular Guard decides if the user can leave the component (navigate away from the current route). This
            route is useful when the user might have some pending changes, which is not yet saved. The CanDeactivate
            route allows us to ask for user confirmation before leaving the component. You might ask the user if itâ€™s OK
            to discard pending changes rather than save them.
        </p>

        <h5><span class="badge text-bg-secondary">Resolve</span></h5>
        <p>This guard delays the activation of the route until some tasks are complete. You can use the guard to
            pre-fetch the data from the backend API before activating the route.
        </p>

        <h5><span class="badge text-bg-secondary">CanLoad</span></h5>
        <p>The CanLoad Guard prevents the loading of the Lazy Loaded Module. We generally use this guard when we do not
            want to unauthorized users to be able even to see the source code of the module.
        </p>
        <p>This guard works similarly to CanActivate guard with one difference. The CanActivate guard prevents a
            particular route from being accessed. The CanLoad prevents the entire lazy-loaded module from being
            downloaded, protecting all the routes within that module.
        </p>

        <h5><span class="badge text-bg-secondary">CanActivateChild</span></h5>
        <p>CanActivateChild guard determines whether a child route can be activated. This guard is very similar to
            CanActivateGuard. We apply this guard to the parent route. The Angular invokes this guard whenever the user
            tries to navigate to any of its child routes. This allows us to check some conditions and decide whether to
            proceed with the navigation or cancel it..
        </p>

        <h5><span class="badge text-bg-secondary">How to Build Angular Route Guards</span></h5>
        <b>1. Build the Guard as Service.</b>
        <b>2. Implement the Guard Method in the Service</b>
        <b>3. Register the Guard Service in the Root Module</b>
        <b>4. Update the Routes to use the guards</b>
