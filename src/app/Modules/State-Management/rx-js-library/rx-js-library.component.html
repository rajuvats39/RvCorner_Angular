        <h3><span class="badge text-bg-primary">Subject VS BehaviourSubject</span></h3>
        <p>Both Subject and BehaviorSubject are Observables</p>

        <h3><span class="badge text-bg-secondary">Subject</span></h3>
        <p> A Subject is a special type of observable that allows values to be multicasted to many observables. In
            simple terms, they are special containers that can hold values, and when a new value comes into a subject,
            that value can be shared with numerous observers at once.</p>
        <p> A Subject is a special type of Observable that allows values to be multicast to multiple observers. Unlike
            regular observables, a Subject can both emit values (as an Observable) and be subscribed to (like an
            Observer).</p>
        <b>Key Characteristics:</b>
        <p><b>No Initial Value:</b>Subject does not store any current value. When a new subscriber subscribes, it does
            not receive any previously emitted value.</p>
        <p><b>Multicasting: </b>It allows multiple observers to listen to the same subject.</p>
        <p><b>Manually Emitting Values: </b>It allows you to emit values manually using next(), It means whenever we
            requird the subscription on action needed.</p>
        <p>It is used whenever we requird emiting and subscribing data with action subscription</p>

        <h3><span class="badge text-bg-secondary">BehaviorSubject</span></h3>
        <p>A BehaviorSubject is a type of Subject that requires an initial value and always provides the current value
            to any new subscribers. It stores the last emitted value, so when a new observer subscribes, it immediately
            receives the most recent value.</p>
        <b>Key Characteristics:</b>
        <p><b>No Initial Value:</b>A BehaviorSubject must be initialized with a default value.</p>
        <p><b>Stores the Latest Value: </b>It stores the last emitted value and provides it to new subscribers even if
            they subscribe after the value has been emitted.</p>
        <p><b>Multicasting: </b>Similar to Subject, it allows multiple subscribers.</p>
        <p>It is used whenever we requird continious emiting and subscribing data without any action subscription</p>

              <tr>
                <td>Previous Value</td>
                <td>Does not store the last value</td>
                <td>Always provides the last emitted value</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Subscribers Behavior</td>
                <td>New subscribers get values from that point onward</td>
                <td>New subscribers immediately receive the last emitted value</td>
              </tr>
              <tr>
                <td>Use Case</td>
                <td>Used when you donâ€™t need to store the last value</td>
                <td>Used when you need to store and replay the last value</td>
              </tr>
            </tbody>

        <b>When to Use:</b>
        <p><b>Subject:</b>Use it when you do not need to remember the last emitted value. Useful for things like button
            clicks, where you want to notify subscribers only about the actions that occur after they subscribe.</p>
        <p><b>BehaviorSubject:</b>Use it when you need to remember the last emitted value and ensure that new
            subscribers receive that value immediately. Ideal for things like form states or data models where you want
            to retain and share the latest state across different parts of your application.</p>
