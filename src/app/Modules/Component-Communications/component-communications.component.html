            Component communication in Angular involves passing data between different components. This is essential for
            building dynamic applications where components need to share information or notify one another of state
            changes. There are several ways to achieve component communication in Angular, depending on the relationship
            between the components

        <h3><span class="badge text-bg-primary">Way Component Communications</span></h3>

        <h5><a class="badge text-bg-secondary" (click)="viewComponentOnAction('parent')">1. Parent to Child
                Communication (Using &#64;Input)</a></h5>
        <p> Use Case: When a parent component needs to pass data to its child component.</p>
        <p>The child component defines an &#64;Input() property to receive the data from the parent.</p>
        <p>The parent component binds the data to the child component's property using property binding in the template.
        </p>

        <h5><a class="badge text-bg-secondary">1.2. Parent to Child Local References in Templates</a></h5>
        <p>Use Case: A simple way to pass data or interact with a child component in the template without using Angular
            decorators.</p>
        <p> You define a local template reference in the parent component template, then access the child component's
            methods or properties.</p>

        <h5><span class="badge text-bg-secondary">1.3. Parent to Child Using &#64;ContentChild and
                &#64;ContentChildren</span></h5>
        <p>Use Case: A simple way to pass data or interact with a child component in the template without using Angular
            decorators.</p>
        <p> You define a local template reference in the parent component template, then access the child component's
            methods or properties.</p>

        <h5><span class="badge text-bg-secondary" (click)="viewComponentOnAction('viewchild')">1.4. Using &#64;ViewChild
                for Parent-Child Communication</span></h5>
        <p> Use Case: When the parent component needs direct access to the child component's methods or properties.</p>
        <p>The parent component uses the &#64;ViewChild() decorator to get a reference to the child component instance.
        </p>

        <h5><span class="badge text-bg-secondary" (click)="viewComponentOnAction('child')">2. Child to Parent
                Communication (Using &#64;Output and
                EventEmitter)</span></h5>
        <p> Use Case: When a child component needs to send data or events back to the parent.</p>
        <p>The child component defines an &#64;Output() property, which is an EventEmitter.</p>
        <p>The parent component listens to this event and handles the emitted data.</p>


        <h5><span class="badge text-bg-secondary" (click)="viewComponentOnAction('Sibling')">3. Sibling to Sibling
                Communication or Unrelated Components(Service with RxJS/Subjects)</span> </h5>
        <p>Use Case: When two sibling components need to communicate. </p>
        <p> A shared service can be used to facilitate communication between sibling components. This service can use
            RxJS Subject or BehaviorSubject to pass data between components.
        </p>
        <p>If two components donâ€™t share a direct parent-child or sibling relationship but still need to communicate, a
            shared service with BehaviorSubject is useful. Unlike Subject, BehaviorSubject retains the latest value,
            making it more reliable for state sharing across the application.
        </p>

        <h5><span class="badge text-bg-secondary" (click)="viewComponentOnAction('router')">4. Using Angular Router
                (Passing Data via Route Parameters)</span>
        </h5>
        <p>You can pass data between components using Angular Router. This is especially useful when navigating between
            components and passing data through URLs or query parameters.</p>
