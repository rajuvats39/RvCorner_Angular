        <p>A service in Angular is a class that contains reusable business logic or functionality that can be shared
            across different components. It is primarily used to encapsulate common functionalities like fetching data
            from an API, logging, authentication, utility functions, and much more.</p>

        <p>Our components need to access the data. You can write data access code in each component, but that is very
            inefficient and breaks the rule of single responsibility. The Component must focus on presenting data to the
            user. The task of getting data from the back-end server must be delegated to some other class. We call such
            a class a Service class. Because it provides the service of providing data to every component that needs it.
        </p>

        <p>01) Services allow us to create reusable code and use it for every component that needs it.
        </p>
        <p>02) The Services can be injected into components and other services using the dependency injection system.
        </p>
        <p>03) The dependencies are declared in the Module using the Providerâ€™s metadata. </p>
        <p>04) The Angular creates a tree of injectors & Providers that resembles the Component Tree. This is called the
            hierarchical pattern.</p>
        <p>05) Service is a piece of reusable code with a focused purpose. A code that you will use in many components
            across your application</p>

        <b>Services are typically designed to:</b>
        <p><b>Promote code reusability:</b> Common logic can be abstracted into services so it can be reused in multiple
            places.</p>
        <p><b>Encapsulate logic:</b> Business logic is separated from components to keep components clean and focused on
            view logic.</p>
        <p><b>Facilitate testing:</b> Services can be unit tested independently of components.</p>
        <p><b>Enable Dependency Injection:</b> Services are injected into components, other services, or directives to
            provide their functionality.</p>

        <p>Features that are independent of components such a logging services</p>
        <p>Share logic or data across components</p>
        <p> Encapsulate external interactions like data access</p>
