        <b>Dependency Injection (DI) is a technique in which a class receives its dependencies from external sources
            rather than creating them itself.</b>

        <p>Dependency Injection (DI) is a design pattern in which a class receives its dependencies from external
            sources rather than creating them itself. Angularâ€™s DI system allows you to inject services, other
            components, or third-party libraries into your Angular classes (components, directives, services, etc.).
        </p>

        <b>Why Use Dependency Injection?:</b>
        <p><b>Inversion of Control:</b> Instead of the class being responsible for creating its dependencies, the
            dependencies are provided by an
            external system (the Angular injector).</p>
        <p><b>Modular and maintainable code:</b> Components and services become more modular because they rely on
            external inputs.</p>
        <p><b>Testability:</b> Dependencies can be mocked or replaced with test-specific implementations, making unit
            testing easier.</p>
        <p><b>Singletons:</b> DI ensures that a single instance of a service can be shared across the application or
            between components, avoiding unnecessary creation of objects.</p>

        <h5><span class="badge text-bg-secondary">Injector</span></h5>
        <p>Injector holds the Providers and is responsible for resolving the dependencies and injecting the instance of
            the Dependency to the Consumer.</p>
        <p>
            The Injector uses Injection Token to search for Dependency in the Providers. It then creates an instance of
            the dependency and injects it into the consumer</p>
        <p>
            It is responsible forcreating and managing the instances of services and injecting them where required.
        </p>
        <b>Key Feature</b>
        <P>
            <b>Creating Services:</b> The Injector is responsible for creating instances of services when they are
            requested, and it also manages their lifecycle, ensuring that the same instance is reused if it's marked as
            a singleton.
        </P>
        <P>
            <b>Providing Dependencies:</b> The Injector supplies the necessary dependencies (services, tokens) to
            components, directives, or other services when required. For instance, if a component needs a service, the
            injector provides that service.
        </P>
        <P>
            <b>Creating Services:</b> The Injector is responsible for creating instances of services when they are
            requested, and it also manages their lifecycle, ensuring that the same instance is reused if it's marked as
            a singleton.
        </P>

        <h5><span class="badge text-bg-secondary">Provider</span></h5>
        <p>The Providers Maintain the list of Dependencies along with their Injection Token. It uses the Injection Token
            is to identify the Dependency. </p>
