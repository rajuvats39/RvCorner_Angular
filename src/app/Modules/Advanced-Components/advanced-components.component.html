            Content projection is a way to pass the HTML content from the parent component to the child component. The
            child component will display the template in a designated spot. We use the ng-content element to designate a
            spot in the template of the child component. The ng-content also allows us to create multiple slots using
            the selector attribute. The parent can send different content to each slot.
        </p>
        <p>
            The ng-content tag acts as a placeholder for inserting external or dynamic content. The Parent component
            passes the external content to the child component. When Angular parses the template, it inserts the
            external content where ng-content appears in the child componentâ€™s template
        </p>

        <p>
            We can use content projection to create a reusable component. The components that have similar logic &
            layout and can be used in many places in the application.
